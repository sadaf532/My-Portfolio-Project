                        Gaming: I am an avid gamer with a particular
                         passion for PUBG PC. Gaming helps me sharpen 
                         my strategic thinking and quick decision-making
                          skills, which are also essential in programming 
                          and problem-solving.

                        Sports: I enjoy playing football and badminton,

                         refreshed. These sports have taught me the value
                          of teamwork, persistence, and maintaining a 
                          competitive spirit.
